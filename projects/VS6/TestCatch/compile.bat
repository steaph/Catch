:: Compile Catch selftests
::

::
:: Note: in several stages of its development, Catch-VC6 gives a memory access
:: violation just (code 0xC0000005) before the program ends (all output is there).
:: When a selection of tests is specified, the problem does not show.
:: The access violation is seen when linking to the default runtime library
:: LIBC.LIB, option /ML and with LIBCMT.LIB, option /MT.
:: Linking to MSVCRT.LIB, option /MD, made the (detection of the) access
:: violation go away.
