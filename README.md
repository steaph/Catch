*CATCH-VC6 v0.9 build 39 (integration branch)*

## What's the Catch?

Catch stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers and is a multi-paradigm automated test framework for C++ and Objective-C (and, maybe, C). It is implemented entirely in a set of header files, but is packaged up as a single header for extra convenience.

## How to use it
This documentation comprises these three parts:

* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md)
* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) - getting started
* [Reference section](docs/reference-index.md) - all the details

## What state is Catch in - can I use it now?

For now Catch is still classed as "in developer preview". However it has already been widely used for over two years. It has proven fairly stable and is in use in some demanding projects. Think of it in the same way that Google uses the term "beta".
At time of writing I'm working towards locking down the public facing interfaces so I can finally give it a 1.0 designation.
